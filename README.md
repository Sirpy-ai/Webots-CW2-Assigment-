## 📝 Overview
This project focuses on creating and setting up a simulation environment using **Webots** for a mobile robot based on AI principles. The robot is programmed with autonomous behavior using sensors and actuators within a designed environment. This assignment forms part of the continuous assessment for the Artificial Intelligence Principles module.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Set up a robot simulation in the Webots platform
- Implement basic robot behavior (navigation, obstacle avoidance, etc.)
- Integrate sensors and motors using controller scripts
- Save the `.wbt` world file and robot controller in Python
- Demonstrate the robot’s autonomous response in a virtual environment
